# XML Writing

I completed an XML writing certificate course from Technical Writer HQ.

As part of the course requirements, I undertook a capstone project. 

For this project, I used Oxygen XML Editor to create a generic user manual for 'Example Software,' a fictional company. 

Written in DITA XML, the manual provides instructions on how to navigate account settings and profile information.
