# XML Writing

I completed a XML writing certificate course at Technical Writer HQ. 

At the end of the course, a capstone project was required to complete the class. 

For my capstone project, I used Oxygen XML Editor (while writing in DITA XML) I created a generic user manual for an "Example Software" (a fictional company) on how to navigate account settings and profile information.
