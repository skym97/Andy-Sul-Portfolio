# Professional Technical Writing at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program

During this program, I participated in several projects that showcased different aspects of technical writing. Each project had a unique scope and allowed me to take on varied roles, including writing, editing, and designing.

## Standard Operating Procedure: Product Defect Software

I contributed to this project as the designer, creating the document’s layout and overall look, including the fictional company’s logo. One teammate wrote the SOP, and another served as the editor. The SOP details the process for addressing product defects in a fictional tech company.

I wrote release notes for the same fictional tech company featured in the SOP. These notes detailed new features and bug fixes for the product defect software. My group members acted as the editor and production designer for this deliverable.
