# Professional Technical Writing at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program

Throughout my time in this program, I partcipated in multiple different projects. The scope of each project varied from projet to project. 

-------------------------

A how-to guide I wrote and created on how to migrate notes from the Samsung Notes App.

For this quick reference guide, I worked with two other group members. For this guide, I served as the editor, while the other group members wrote and designed the document. The deliverable covers AI in education. 

Note: The group members I worked with for this project I would go on to work with for the Quick Reference Guide and the Standard Operating Procedure as well.

A standard operating procedure for a fictional tech company that was written by one of my group members. I was the designer for this project as I created the actual document, while another member edited the document. Additionally, I was in charge of the look and layout of the manual. The fictional company logo was something I created as well. The SOP covers product defect software.

A release note that I wrote for the same fictional company used in the standard operating procedure. My other group members served as the editor and the production designer. The release note covers new features and bug fixes to the fictional product defect software used in the SOP.

A knowledge base article that I wrote in a group with 5 other members where we created a knowledge base for aspiring technical writers. For this project we created a persona to write these articles for and put thogether 6 different articles to be displayed on this website. For my knowledge base article, I wrote about creating release notes.
