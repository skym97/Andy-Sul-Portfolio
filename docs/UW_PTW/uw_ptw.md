# Professional Technical Writing at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program

Through my time in this program, I partcipated in multiple different projects. The scope of each project varied from projet to project. 

-------------------------

A how-to guide I wrote and created on how to migrate notes from the Samsung Notes App.

For this quick reference guide, I worked with two other group members. For this guide, I was the editor, while other group members wrote and designed the document. The deliverable covers AI in education.

A standard operating procedure for a fictional tech company that was written by one of my group members. I was the production designer for this project as I created the actual document, while others edited and created the content for this project. Additionally, I was in charge of the look and layout of the manual. The fictional company logo was something I created as well. The SOP covers product defect software.

A release note that I wrote for the same fictional company used in the standard operating procedure. The release note covers new features and bug fixes to the fictional product defect software used in the SOP. My other group members served as the editor and the production designer.

A knowledge base article that I wrote in a group with 5 other members where we created a knowledge base for aspiring technical writers. For this project we created a persona to write these articles for and put thogether 6 different articles to be displayed on this website. For my knowledge base article, I wrote about creating release notes.
