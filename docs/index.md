-------------------------

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio!

This is my page where I showcase my technical writing portfolio from various different classes and certificates I have completed.

Most of the work you'll see in my portfolio come from two different classes I took from the University of Washington's Professional Continuing Education program tailored specifically for technical writing.

-------------------------

## About Me

I'm currently a technical writing working in the public sector. In addition to technical writing, I also have a background in retail, sales, and customer support. 

I hope to learn and gain the skills that are necessary and in demand to build a long term career for myself in this field.
