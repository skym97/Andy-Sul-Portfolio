# Technical Writing Portfolio

-------------------------

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio!

This is my page where I showcase my technical writing portfolio from various different classes and certificates I have completed.

Most of the work you'll see in my portfolio come from three different classes I took through the University of Washington's Professional Continuing Education program. 
Two of the three courses are tailored specifically for technical writing.

## About Me

I'm currently a technical writer working for a training company that specializes in the public sector. 

In addition to technical writing, I also have a background in retail, sales, and customer support. 

I hope to learn and gain the skills that are necessary and in demand to build a long term career for myself in this field.
