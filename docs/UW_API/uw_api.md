# API Documentation at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program

For this class, I worked on a portfolio project where I had to write documentation for a mock API service created by another classmate that acted as the SME. 

The classmate was responsible for creating the JSON database the API would be sourced from. 

Once the database file was provided, I went onto create documentation around that file while consulting with the SME from time to time.

Additionally, I also served as a SME for another project (but did not create documentation for).
