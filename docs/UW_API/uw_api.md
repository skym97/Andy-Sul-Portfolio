# API Documentation at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program

In this class, I worked on a portfolio project where I created documentation for a mock API service. 

The API and its JSON database were developed by a classmate who acted as the Subject Matter Expert (SME).

After receiving the database file, I developed documentation for the API, collaborating with the SME as needed to ensure accuracy and completeness.

In addition to creating documentation, I also served as the SME for another project, where I provided the database file but did not write documentation.
