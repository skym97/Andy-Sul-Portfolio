# Fundamentals of Programming (Python) at the University of Washington's Professional Continuing Education Program

This class covered the basics and fundamentals of Python programming.

Although the course itself didnâ€™t include a documentation component, I took the initiative to create documentation for the final project as part of my learning process.

You can view the documentation I created for this project through the link below:
