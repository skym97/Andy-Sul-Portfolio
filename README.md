### Professional Technical Writing at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program

The works showcased below were created while taking apart of the Professional Technical Writing course at the University of Washington's Professional Continuning Education Program. The program started on January 2023 and ended in August 2023. Upon completion a certificate was issued.

*[How-to Guide](https://github.com/skym97/Portfolio/blob/main/How%20to%20Guide.pdf)*									

A how-to guide I wrote and created for my technical writing course on how to migrate notes from the Samsung Notes App.

*[Quick Reference Guide](https://github.com/skym97/Portfolio/blob/main/Quick%20Reference%20Guide.pdf)*								

For this quick reference guide, I was a part of with two other group members in my technical writing course. For this guide, I was the editor, while other group members wrote and designed the document. The deliverable covers AI in education. 

*[Standard Operating Procedure](https://github.com/skym97/Portfolio/blob/main/Standard%20Operating%20Procedure.pdf)*

A standard operating procedure for a fictional tech company that was written by one of my group members in my technical writing course. I was the production designer for this project as I created the actual document. Additionally, I was in charge of the look and layout of the manual. The fictional company logo was something I created as well. The SOP covers product defect software. Another group member served as the editor.

*[Release Notes](https://github.com/skym97/Portfolio/blob/main/Release%20Note.pdf)*

A release note that I wrote for the same fictional company used in the previous manual/SOP (listed above) for my technical writing course. The release note covers new features and bug fixes to the fictional product defect software used in the SOP. My other group members served as the editor and the production designer. 

*[Knowledge Base Article](https://vandevan4.wixsite.com/tech-writing/creating-release-notes)*

A knowledge base article that I wrote in a group with 5 other members where we created a knowledge base for aspiring technical writers. For this project we created a persona to write these articles for and put thogether 6 different articles to be displayed on this website. For my knowledge base article, I wrote about creating release notes.

I also completed a second course on Udemy called Learn API Technical Writing 2: REST for Writers (also by Peter Gruenbaum, and his 2nd course in the series). The documentation exercises shown below are a part of the course. 

Note: Exercise #4 is the most "comprehensive" exercise of the bunch.
